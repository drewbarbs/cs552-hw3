A ramdisk file system

by Andrew Barbarello and Seule Ki Kim

To build ramdisk run 'make' in ramdisk_module directory
To build tests, run 'make' in rd_lib directory: prof_tests will be an executable
   running those tests provided by the professor, our_tests will be our own.
   (make sure to insmod ramdisk module before running tests)
